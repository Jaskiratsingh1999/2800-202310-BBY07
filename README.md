## 1. Project Description
Our team, BBY07, is developing Meal Genie - a personalized recipe app that helps health-conscious foodies with dietary preferences and cooking skills to discover new recipes and make informed and healthy choices, all powered by advanced algorithms and AI. 

## 2. Names of Contributors

* Jaskirat Singh - Hello! I'm a computer systems technology student at BCIT who has always been fascinated by the world of programming languages. From my early experiences with Java,  I've developed a strong foundation in coding. In addition to my love for coding, I find great joy in outdoor activities like playing cricket and hiking. The combination of my passion for programming and my love for the outdoors defines who I am as an individual, always seeking new challenges and opportunities for growth in both worlds.
* Yousuf Rabani - Hey there, I'm currently a first-year CST student at BCIT. My current experience includes working with
              JavaScript and front-end development, but I'm eager to learn and explore more programming languages as I
              progress - C# being on top of my list. Apart from coding, I enjoy spending time in nature, birdwatching,
              and capturing the beauty of wildlife through my photography.
* Anshul Gautam - Hey, I'm Anshul! I'm currently enrolled in the Computer Systems Technology
              program at BCIT, where I'm gaining
              knowledge in the world of technology. I love photography which leads me to try flying drones and capture
              stunning aerial shots, and when I'm not behind the camera, I'm either cycling or playing my guitar.
